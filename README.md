# FAModel

The FAModel (or Floating Array Model) package serves as a high-level library for
modeling a floating wind array. It combines site condition information and a 
description of the floating array design, and contains functions for evaluating
the array's behavior considering the site conditions. For example, it combines
information about site soil conditions and an array's anchor characteristics to
estimate the holding capacity of each anchor.

## Subpackages

- anchors: contains modules for anchor capacity calculations
